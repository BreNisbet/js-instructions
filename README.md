# js-instructions
## Intro
This is a set of insturctions to go through the basics of codeing. I'll be focusing on exercises that have a visual element in an rough order of what I did when learning to code. This means it will focus on game dev type stuff so if you are not intersted in that, to bad. 

## Set up
In the folder template there's a hello world progame that will be the base of what we are working with. You can ignore site.html, this is just to have something to open. To get started download this project from github, then unzip it. Open site.html in a broswer and code.js in an IDE. For now notepad++ will work and is easy to set up but I would recommend Visual Studio Code. <br>
If you now add some code to code.js, save it and reload site.html it should work! Start by adding `alert("hello")` anywhere on the file. If everything is working properly you should see a popup in your browser.
